Their mean age was 26 years when first seen and they had on average been known to the Home office less than two years, 79 were male. At the end of the follow-up period, 25 were off opiates and 17 were dead. A series of cases is followed-up in relation to their stage of addiction. The number of opiate-free patients after Jive years is shown to be significantly different for the three stages. In relation to the Stage for II (i.e. “early” or “pre-chronic”) addict, it is suggested tentatively that drug withdrawal must be effected after no, or limited, opiate prescription. The outlook for the chronic (Stage III) addict appears poor, and the limited apparent improvement that is shown must be considered in the light of an evidently growing black market m adulterated, imported (“Chinese”) heroin.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate the extent of the involvement of opioid users in residential burglary offences estimates were made of the proportions of persons who were notified addicts amongst all those prosecuted in 1983 and convicted of the offence by courts in four London and two Merseyside Petty Sessional Divisions (PSDs). The proportions ranged from 1\% to 15\% in the Merseyside PSDs and from 3\% to 11\% in the London PSDs. The factors likely to account for these variations, including differences in police clear-up rates for the offence, are discussed. It is concluded that the presence of relatively large numbers of young male opioid users in a local population may well contribute to increases in the number of residential burglary offences in the area.
